# First Widget

This is a the simplest possible useful widget. It is a landing page implemented in
Javascript, utilizing just a handful of libraries loaded via a CDN. At present it uses a
public CDN, but for greater stability, future-proofing, security, and support we should
use our own internal CDN.

The widget implements a landing page for a relatively simple type, the `Media` workspace
type.
