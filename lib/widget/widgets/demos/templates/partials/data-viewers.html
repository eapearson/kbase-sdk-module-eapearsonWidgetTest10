<h1>Data Viewers</h1>

<p>Data viewers all share a common goal - to visualize a single data object from a
Narrative (or other workspace, e.g. reference data.)</p>

<p>We also call them "landing pages".</p>

<p>A data viewer takes an object ref path and, optionally, a sub-object path.</p>

<p>It is uncommon for a dataviewer to utilize any other parameters. The two extant cases
provide a single extra constant parameter each to control a characteristic of the
display.</p>
